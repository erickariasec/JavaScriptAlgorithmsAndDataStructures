/*
    In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

    For example, the following code:

        let myStr = "Bob";
        myStr[0] = "J";

    cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

        let myStr = "Bob";
        myStr = "Job";
*/

// Configuration
let myStr = "Jello World";

// Just change the code bellow
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line
// Just change the code above
